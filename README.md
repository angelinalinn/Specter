Story: 
You’ve been hired as a ghost investigator working under the SPECTER Association to investigate a house that has been reported for multiple sightings of paranormal activity. Your mission is simple: identify the type of ghost haunting the house by collecting evidence, and make sure to survive the night. But you must be wary; every moment spent in the haunted house drains your sanity, and once your sanity hits zero, you will die.

To identify the ghost type, you should explore the house and collect evidence by using the equipment provided in your bag. Read the Ghost Journal for more information. Most evidence can be found in the ghost’s favorite room. After collecting evidence, write down your guess in the Investigator’s Ghost Report and return to the front yard to end the game. 

Main Goal: 
Identify the type of the ghost haunting the house by collecting evidence.
Survive. (Prevent sanity from dropping to 0)

Tasks:

Find the Ghost Room
Use your EMF reader to locate the ghosts’ favorite room. A reading of EMF 2 indicates the ghost’s favorite room, where most paranormal activity and evidence is found.

Collect evidence
Use various tools in your bag to gather evidence. Each type of evidence will help you narrow down what type of ghost you're dealing with. Keep an eye out for:
EMF Level 5 readings
Fingerprints
Freezing temperatures
Spirit box responses

Keep Your Sanity in Check 
The longer you stay in the house, the lower your sanity will drop. Once past a certain threshold, the ghost will be driven to try to kill you. If your sanity reaches zero, you will die. 
Use holy water, crucifix, and rosary to attack the ghost or help keep your mental state intact.

Identify Ghost Type
Once you've collected enough evidence, consult your Investigator’s Ghost Report to make your best guess on the ghost’s type.
Ghosts can be of various types, each with unique behaviors and evidence combinations (e.g., Poltergeists, Banshees, Revenants, Phantoms, etc.).

Escape Alive
After you’ve made your guess, head back to the van to end the investigation. If you guessed correctly, the investigation is successful.
